# BlogSlog: A web app written in Python using flask
This is a very simple web application written in python using the web application framework Flask. It's a very simple blog app
that will accept user input through forms. Hopefully it will even have an authentication system.

## What is this app for?
I created this app in order for me to get accustomed to using Postgresql with Flask. All of the other Flask apps that I've written have
just used sqllite, which is great for creating simple apps that run locally, but isn't that great for production. Hopefully this will help
to improve my skills with Postgresql and Flask.

## I wish to install this app for some reason. How do I go about doing that?
Great question. First you need to install the requirements.

`virtualenv myVirtualEnvironment`
`source /path/to/myVirtualEnvironment/bin/activate`
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
(or your operating system's equivalent)

## Can I use this code?
Yes.
